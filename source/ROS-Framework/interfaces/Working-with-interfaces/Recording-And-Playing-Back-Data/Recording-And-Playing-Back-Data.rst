Recording and playing back data - how-to
========================================

``ros2 bag`` records data from topics, services, and actions in a ROS system so you can save and replay it later.
This article shows you how to record, inspect, and play back that data with the ``ros2 bag`` command-line tools.
Worked examples cover the same pattern for topics, services, and actions.

Summary
-------

Use ``ros2 bag record`` to save data from topics, services, and actions, ``ros2 bag info`` to inspect a recording, and ``ros2 bag play`` to replay it.
Recordings are stored as bag directories that you can share or reuse to reproduce experiments.

Prerequisites
-------------

#. :doc:`Install ROS <../../../../Get-Started/Installation>` if needed.
#. Familiarity with :doc:`nodes <../../../nodes/Working-with-nodes/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes>`, :doc:`topics <../../topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics>`, :doc:`services <../../services/Working-with-services/Understanding-ROS2-Services/Understanding-ROS2-Services>`, and :doc:`actions <../../actions/Working-with-actions/Understanding-ROS2-Actions/Understanding-ROS2-Actions>`.

Steps
-----

.. note::
   Source ROS in every new terminal you open.
   See :doc:`Configuring environment <../../../../Get-Started/Configuring-ROS2-Environment>`.

Record, inspect, and play back topics
-------------------------------------

1 Run the turtlesim nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The topic examples use the ``turtlesim`` package.
Run the ``/turtlesim`` and ``/teleop_turtle`` nodes before recording keyboard input.

Open a new terminal and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node

Open another terminal and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

Create a directory to store recordings:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Linux

        .. code-block:: console

            $ mkdir bag_files
            $ cd bag_files

    .. group-tab:: macOS

        .. code-block:: console

            $ mkdir bag_files
            $ cd bag_files

    .. group-tab:: Windows

        .. code-block:: console

            $ md bag_files
            $ cd bag_files


2 Choose a topic to record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ros2 bag`` can record data from messages published to topics.
To list active topics, open a new terminal and run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 topic list

The terminal returns:

.. code-block:: console

  /parameter_events
  /rosout
  /turtle1/cmd_vel
  /turtle1/color_sensor
  /turtle1/pose

As shown in :doc:`Understanding topics <../../topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics>`, the ``/teleop_turtle`` node publishes commands on the ``/turtle1/cmd_vel`` topic to move the turtle in Turtlesim.

To see the data that ``/turtle1/cmd_vel`` is publishing, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel

Nothing appears at first because the teleop node is not publishing yet.
Return to the terminal where you ran the teleop node and select it so it is active.
Use the arrow keys to move the turtle around.
Data appears in the terminal running ``ros2 topic echo``:

.. code-block:: console

  linear:
    x: 2.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0
  angular:
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0
    ---


3 Record topics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3.1 Record a single topic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To record the data published to a topic use the command syntax:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 bag record --topics <topic_name>

Before running this command, open a new terminal and move into the ``bag_files`` directory you created earlier.
The bag directory is created in the working directory where you run ``ros2 bag record``.

Run the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 bag record --topics /turtle1/cmd_vel
    [INFO] [rosbag2_storage]: Opened database 'rosbag2_2019_10_11-05_18_45'.
    [INFO] [rosbag2_transport]: Listening for topics...
    [INFO] [rosbag2_transport]: Subscribed to topic '/turtle1/cmd_vel'
    [INFO] [rosbag2_transport]: All requested topics are subscribed. Stopping discovery...

Now ``ros2 bag`` is recording the data published on the ``/turtle1/cmd_vel`` topic.
Return to the teleop terminal and move the turtle around again.
The exact path does not matter, but try to make a recognisable pattern to verify playback later.

.. image:: images/record.png

Press :kbd:`Ctrl-C` to stop recording.

The data will be accumulated in a new bag directory with a name in the pattern of ``rosbag2_year_month_day-hour_minute_second``.
This directory will contain a ``metadata.yaml`` along with the bag file in the recorded format.

3.2 Record multiple topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also record multiple topics, as well as change the name of the bag directory ``ros2 bag`` saves to.

Run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag record -o subset --topics /turtle1/cmd_vel /turtle1/pose
  [INFO] [rosbag2_storage]: Opened database 'subset'.
  [INFO] [rosbag2_transport]: Listening for topics...
  [INFO] [rosbag2_transport]: Subscribed to topic '/turtle1/cmd_vel'
  [INFO] [rosbag2_transport]: Subscribed to topic '/turtle1/pose'
  [INFO] [rosbag2_transport]: All requested topics are subscribed. Stopping discovery...

The ``-o`` option allows you to choose a unique name for your bag directory.
The following string, in this case ``subset``, is the bag directory name.

To record more than one topic at a time, simply list each topic separated by a space after ``--topics``.
In this case, the command output above confirms that both topics are being recorded.

You can move the turtle around and press :kbd:`Ctrl-C` when you're finished.

.. note::

    There is another option you can add to the command, ``-a`` / ``--all``, which records all topics, services, and actions.
    To record only topics, use ``--all-topics``.

3.3 Split recording into multiple files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also split your recording into multiple files, based on either recording duration or file size.
``-d <max_bag_duration>`` ensures that each file only lasts ``<max_bag_duration>`` seconds before it starts writing to a new file, or ``-b <max_bag_size>`` ensures that each file does not exceed ``<max_bag_size>`` bytes in file size.
This prevents large and unwieldy file sizes, and protects against losing all data if the recording operation becomes corrupted at some point.

Run the following for at least 15 seconds, allowing for three 5-second bag files to be written:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 bag record -o subset_split -d 5 --topics /turtle1/cmd_vel /turtle1/pose
    [INFO] [rosbag2_recorder]: Press SPACE for pausing/resuming
    [INFO] [rosbag2_recorder]: Listening for topics...
    [INFO] [rosbag2_recorder]: Event publisher thread: Starting
    [INFO] [rosbag2_recorder]: Recording...
    [INFO] [rosbag2_recorder]: Subscribed to topic '/turtle1/cmd_vel'
    [INFO] [rosbag2_recorder]: Subscribed to topic '/turtle1/pose'
    [INFO] [rosbag2_recorder]: All requested topics are subscribed. Stopping discovery...
    [INFO] [rosbag2_cpp]: Writing remaining messages from cache to the bag. It may take a while
    [INFO] [rosbag2_cpp]: Writing remaining messages from cache to the bag. It may take a while
    [INFO] [rosbag2_cpp]: Writing remaining messages from cache to the bag. It may take a while

Press :kbd:`Ctrl-C` when you're finished.
You should find a ``subset_split`` directory with these files inside: ``0_subset_split_YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS.mcap``, ``1_subset_split_YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS.mcap``, and so on.

.. note::

   Split file naming changed in Lyrical.
   On earlier distributions the files may instead look like ``subset_split_0.mcap``, ``subset_split_1.mcap``, and so on.

4 Inspect a topic recording
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see details about a recording, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 bag info <bag_name>

Running this command on the ``subset`` bag recording will return a list of information:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 bag info subset
    Files:             subset_0.mcap
    Bag size:          228.5 KiB
    Storage id:        mcap
    ROS Distro:        rolling
    Duration:          48.47s
    Start:             Oct 11 2019 06:09:09.12 (1570799349.12)
    End                Oct 11 2019 06:09:57.60 (1570799397.60)
    Messages:          3013
    Topic information: Topic: /turtle1/cmd_vel | Type: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist | Count: 9 | Serialization Format: cdr
                       Topic: /turtle1/pose | Type: turtlesim_msgs/msg/Pose | Count: 3004 | Serialization Format: cdr
    Services:          0
    Service information:
    Actions:           0
    Action information:

Alternatively, you can also call ``ros2 bag info`` on an individual file, such as ``subset_split/0_subset_split_YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS.mcap``, and it will only show information for that portion of the recording; in this case, the first 5 seconds.

5 Play back topic data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

5.1 Play a single bag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before replaying the bag, enter :kbd:`Ctrl-C` in the terminal where the teleop node is running.
Make sure the Turtlesim window is visible so you can see playback.

Run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 bag play subset
    [INFO] [rosbag2_player]: Set rate to 1
    [INFO] [rosbag2_player]: Adding keyboard callbacks.
    [INFO] [rosbag2_player]: Press SPACE for Pause/Resume
    [INFO] [rosbag2_player]: Press CURSOR_RIGHT for Play Next Message
    [INFO] [rosbag2_player]: Press CURSOR_UP for Increase Rate 10%
    [INFO] [rosbag2_player]: Press CURSOR_DOWN for Decrease Rate 10%
    Progress bar enabled at 3 Hz.
    Progress bar [?]: [R]unning, [P]aused, [B]urst, [D]elayed, [S]topped
    [INFO] [rosbag2_player]: Playback until timestamp: -1


    ====== Playback Progress ======
    [1751923361.427372456] Duration 0.00/48.47 [R]

The turtle follows approximately the same path entered during recording.
Turtlesim is sensitive to small changes in system timing, so playback may not match exactly.

.. image:: images/playback.png

Because the ``subset`` file recorded the ``/turtle1/pose`` topic, ``ros2 bag play`` does not exit until playback finishes, even if the turtle was not moving during recording.

While the ``/turtlesim`` node is active, it publishes data on the ``/turtle1/pose`` topic at regular intervals.
In the ``ros2 bag info`` example above, the ``/turtle1/cmd_vel`` topic ``Count`` is 9, matching the number of arrow-key presses during recording.

The ``/turtle1/pose`` topic ``Count`` is over 3000 because data was published on that topic throughout the recording.

To see how often position data is published, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 topic hz /turtle1/pose

5.2 Play multiple bags in parallel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can split recorded topics across separate bags to distribute the recording workload.
For example, record ``/turtle1/cmd_vel`` and ``/turtle1/pose`` in separate terminals.

In the first terminal, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 bag record -o subset_cmd_vel --topics /turtle1/cmd_vel

In the second terminal, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 bag record -o subset_pose --topics /turtle1/pose

Move the turtle around, then stop both recordings with :kbd:`Ctrl-C`.

To play these recordings together with correct timing, pass ``-i <bag_name>`` for each bag:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 bag play -i subset_cmd_vel -i subset_pose

This plays the ``subset_cmd_vel`` and ``subset_pose`` recordings together, with playback synced to replicate the original message order.
The optional argument ``--message-order {received,sent}`` sets whether messages are sequenced by receive time or publish time.
The default is ``received``.
This option also applies when playing a single bag.

Record, inspect, and play back services
---------------------------------------

.. note::

   Recording and playing back services requires Jazzy or a later distribution.

1 Run the introspection demo nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The service examples use the :doc:`Service Introspection Demo <../../../../Developer-Tools/Introspection-and-analysis/Service-Introspection>`.
Service introspection must be enabled on both the client and server nodes to record service data.

Open a new terminal and run ``introspection_service`` with service introspection enabled:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp introspection_service --ros-args -p service_configure_introspection:=contents

Open another terminal and run ``introspection_client`` with service introspection enabled:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp introspection_client --ros-args -p client_configure_introspection:=contents

2 Check that services are available
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ros2 bag`` can only record data from available services.
To list active services, open a new terminal and run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 service list

The terminal returns:

.. code-block:: console

  /add_two_ints
  /introspection_client/describe_parameters
  /introspection_client/get_parameter_types
  /introspection_client/get_parameters
  /introspection_client/get_type_description
  /introspection_client/list_parameters
  /introspection_client/set_parameters
  /introspection_client/set_parameters_atomically
  /introspection_service/describe_parameters
  /introspection_service/get_parameter_types
  /introspection_service/get_parameters
  /introspection_service/get_type_description
  /introspection_service/list_parameters
  /introspection_service/set_parameters
  /introspection_service/set_parameters_atomically

To verify that service introspection is enabled, run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 service echo --flow-style /add_two_ints
  info:
    event_type: REQUEST_SENT
    stamp:
      sec: 1713995389
      nanosec: 386809259
    client_gid: [1, 15, 96, 219, 162, 1, 108, 201, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 21, 3]
    sequence_number: 133
  request: [{a: 2, b: 3}]
  response: []
  ---

You should see the service communication.

3 Record services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To record service data, the following options are supported.
Service data can be recorded with topics at the same time.

To record specific services:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag record --services <service_names>

To record all services:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag record --all-services

Run the command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag record --services /add_two_ints
  [INFO] [1713995957.643573503] [rosbag2_recorder]: Press SPACE for pausing/resuming
  [INFO] [1713995957.662067587] [rosbag2_recorder]: Event publisher thread: Starting
  [INFO] [1713995957.662067614] [rosbag2_recorder]: Listening for topics...
  [INFO] [1713995957.666048323] [rosbag2_recorder]: Subscribed to topic '/add_two_ints/_service_event'
  [INFO] [1713995957.666092458] [rosbag2_recorder]: Recording...

Now ``ros2 bag`` is recording the service data published on the ``/add_two_ints`` service.
To stop the recording, enter :kbd:`Ctrl-C` in the terminal.

The data will be accumulated in a new bag directory with a name in the pattern of ``rosbag2_year_month_day-hour_minute_second``.
This directory will contain a ``metadata.yaml`` along with the bag file in the recorded format.

4 Inspect a service recording
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see details about a recording, run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag info <bag_file_name>
  Files:             rosbag2_2024_04_24-14_59_17_0.mcap
  Bag size:          15.1 KiB
  Storage id:        mcap
  ROS Distro:        rolling
  Duration:          9.211s
  Start:             Apr 24 2024 14:59:17.676 (1713995957.676)
  End:               Apr 24 2024 14:59:26.888 (1713995966.888)
  Messages:          0
  Topic information:
  Service:           1
  Service information: Service: /add_two_ints | Type: example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts | Event Count: 78 | Serialization Format: cdr

5 Play back service data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before replaying the bag file, enter :kbd:`Ctrl-C` in the terminal where ``introspection_client`` is running.
When ``introspection_client`` stops, ``introspection_service`` also stops printing results because there are no incoming requests.

Playback sends service requests from the bag file to ``introspection_service``.

Run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag play --publish-service-requests <bag_file_name>
  [INFO] [1713997477.870856190] [rosbag2_player]: Set rate to 1
  [INFO] [1713997477.877417477] [rosbag2_player]: Adding keyboard callbacks.
  [INFO] [1713997477.877442404] [rosbag2_player]: Press SPACE for Pause/Resume
  [INFO] [1713997477.877447855] [rosbag2_player]: Press CURSOR_RIGHT for Play Next Message
  [INFO] [1713997477.877452655] [rosbag2_player]: Press CURSOR_UP for Increase Rate 10%
  [INFO] [1713997477.877456954] [rosbag2_player]: Press CURSOR_DOWN for Decrease Rate 10%
  [INFO] [1713997477.877573647] [rosbag2_player]: Playback until timestamp: -1

The ``introspection_service`` terminal starts printing service messages again:

.. code-block:: console

  [INFO] [1713997478.090466075] [introspection_service]: Incoming request
  a: 2 b: 3

``ros2 bag play`` sends the service request data from the bag file to the ``/add_two_ints`` service.

To inspect service communication during playback, run this command before ``ros2 bag play``:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 service echo --flow-style /add_two_ints

The output shows the service request from the bag file and the response from ``introspection_service``.

.. code-block:: console

  info:
    event_type: REQUEST_RECEIVED
    stamp:
      sec: 1713998176

    sequence_number: 1
  request: []
  response: [{sum: 5}]

.. _record-play-data-action:

Record, inspect, and play back actions
----------------------------------------

.. note::

   Recording and playing back actions requires Kilted or a later distribution.

1 Run the fibonacci demo nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The action examples use the :doc:`Action Introspection Demo <../../actions/Working-with-actions/Action-Introspection>`.
Action introspection must be enabled on both the client and server nodes to record action data.

Open a new terminal and run ``fibonacci_action_server`` with action introspection enabled:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 run action_tutorials_py fibonacci_action_server --ros-args -p action_server_configure_introspection:=contents

Open another terminal and run ``fibonacci_action_client`` with action introspection enabled:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 run action_tutorials_cpp fibonacci_action_client --ros-args -p action_client_configure_introspection:=contents

2 Check that actions are available
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ros2 bag`` can only record data from available actions.
To list active actions, open a new terminal and run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 action list

The terminal returns:

.. code-block:: console

  /fibonacci

To verify that action introspection is enabled, run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 action echo --flow-style /fibonacci
  interface: GOAL_SERVICE
  info:
    event_type: REQUEST_SENT
    stamp:
      sec: 1744917904
      nanosec: 760683446
    client_gid: [1, 15, 165, 231, 234, 109, 65, 202, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 19, 4]
    sequence_number: 1
  request: [{goal_id: {uuid: [81, 55, 121, 145, 81, 66, 209, 93, 214, 113, 255, 100, 120, 6, 102, 83]}, goal: {order: 10}}]
  response: []
  ---
  ...

3 Record actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To record action data, the following options are supported.
Action data can be recorded with topics and services at the same time.

To record specific actions:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag record --actions <action_names>

To record all actions:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag record --all-actions

Run the command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag record --actions /fibonacci
  [INFO] [1744953225.214114862] [rosbag2_recorder]: Press SPACE for pausing/resuming

  [INFO] [1744953225.735061252] [rosbag2_recorder]: Subscribed to topic '/fibonacci/_action/status'
  ...

Now ``ros2 bag`` is recording the action data for the ``/fibonacci`` action: goal, result, and feedback.
To stop the recording, enter :kbd:`Ctrl-C` in the terminal.

The data will be accumulated in a new bag directory with a name in the pattern of ``rosbag2_year_month_day-hour_minute_second``.
This directory will contain a ``metadata.yaml`` along with the bag file in the recorded format.

4 Inspect an action recording
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see details about a recording, run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag info <bag_file_name>
  Files:             rosbag2_2025_04_17-22_20_40_0.mcap

5 Play back action data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before replaying the bag file, enter :kbd:`Ctrl-C` in the terminal where ``fibonacci_action_client`` is running.
When ``fibonacci_action_client`` stops, ``fibonacci_action_server`` also stops printing results because there are no incoming requests.

Playback sends action goal requests from the bag file to ``fibonacci_action_server``.

Run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 bag play --send-actions-as-client <bag_file_name>

``ros2 bag play`` sends the action goal request data from the bag file to the ``/fibonacci`` action.

To inspect action communication during playback, run this command before ``ros2 bag play``:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 action echo --flow-style /fibonacci

The output shows the action goal request from the bag file and responses from ``fibonacci_action_server``:

.. code-block:: console

FAQs
----

What does ``ros2 bag`` record?
   It can record data from topics, services, and actions in your ROS system.
   You choose which interfaces to record with options such as ``--topics``, ``--services``, and ``--actions``.

Where are recordings saved?
   In a bag directory created in the working directory where you run ``ros2 bag record``.
   Use ``-o`` to set a custom directory name.
   Each bag directory contains metadata and the recorded data files.

How do I inspect a recording before playing it back?
   Run ``ros2 bag info <bag_name>``.
   The output lists duration, message counts, and which topics, services, and actions were recorded.

How do I play back service or action data?
   For services, use ``ros2 bag play --publish-service-requests <bag_file_name>``.
   For actions, use ``ros2 bag play --send-actions-as-client <bag_file_name>``.
   Topic playback uses ``ros2 bag play <bag_name>``.
