.. _ROS2CliLogging:

Learning about CLI logging - tutorial
=====================================

Log messages report what a node is doing, and each message has a severity level.
This article walks you through writing a small battery-monitor node that logs at different severities, then using the ROS CLI to show or hide those messages.
A hands-on exercise shows why ``DEBUG`` is hidden by default and how ``--log-level`` reveals it.

Summary
-------

ROS nodes use log messages to report status and problems.
Severity levels, from least to most severe, are ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``, ``WARN``, ``ERROR``, and ``FATAL``.
By default, a node prints ``INFO`` and above.
Use ``--ros-args --log-level`` to change which severities are shown when you run a node.

For more information, see :doc:`About logging <../../About-Logging/About-Logging>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Make sure you understand the concepts covered in :doc:`Learning about nodes <../Understanding-ROS2-Nodes/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes>`.
* You will need a workspace and a basic understanding of how to build a Python package.
  See :doc:`Creating a workspace <../../../client-libraries/Working-with-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace>` and :doc:`Creating a package <../../../client-libraries/Working-with-Client-Libraries/Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package>`.
* A basic Python publisher or subscriber tutorial is useful background, for example :doc:`Writing a simple publisher and subscriber (Python) <../../../client-libraries/Working-with-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber>`.

Steps
-----

.. note::
    Make sure to source ROS in every new terminal you open.

    For more information, see :doc:`Configuring environment <../../../../Get-Started/Configuring-ROS2-Environment>`.

1 Create a package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by creating a package to hold the battery-monitor node that you will build in the next step.

Open a terminal, source your ROS installation, and move into the ``src`` directory of your workspace.

Create a Python package for the battery monitor:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --license Apache-2.0 battery_logging --dependencies rclpy

Your terminal returns a message confirming that the ``battery_logging`` package and its files were created.

2 Write the battery monitor node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add a node that logs at each severity level as a simulated battery drains.
That gives you controlled messages to inspect with the CLI in the later steps.

Navigate into the package module directory:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd battery_logging/battery_logging

Create a file named ``battery_monitor.py`` and paste the following code:

.. code-block:: python

  import rclpy
  from rclpy.node import Node


  class BatteryMonitor(Node):

      def __init__(self):
          super().__init__('battery_monitor')
          self.level = 100
          self.warn_threshold = 30
          self.error_threshold = 10
          self.warned = False
          self.errored = False

          self.get_logger().info(
              f'Battery monitor started, initial level {self.level}%')
          self.timer = self.create_timer(0.5, self.timer_callback)

      def timer_callback(self):
          self.get_logger().debug(f'Battery level: {self.level}%')

          if self.level <= 0:
              self.get_logger().fatal(
                  'Battery depleted, shutting down battery monitor')
              raise SystemExit

          if self.level <= self.error_threshold and not self.errored:
              self.get_logger().error(
                  f'Battery critically low at {self.level}%, stop immediately')
              self.errored = True
          elif self.level <= self.warn_threshold and not self.warned:
              self.get_logger().warning(
                  'Battery low, please return to dock')
              self.warned = True

          self.level -= 5


  def main(args=None):
      rclpy.init(args=args)
      node = BatteryMonitor()
      try:
          rclpy.spin(node)
      except (SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt):
          pass
      finally:
          node.get_logger().info('Battery monitor shutting down')
          node.destroy_node()
          if rclpy.ok():
              rclpy.shutdown()


  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

Save the file.

The node does the following:

* On startup, it logs ``INFO`` with the initial battery level.
* Every 0.5 second, it logs ``DEBUG`` with the current reading and drains the battery by 5 %.
* The first time the level reaches 30 % or below, it logs ``WARN``.
* The first time the level reaches 10 % or below, it logs ``ERROR``.
* When the level reaches 0 %, it logs ``FATAL``, then the node shuts down and logs ``INFO`` on the way out.

``WARN`` and ``ERROR`` are printed only the first time each threshold is crossed, so the terminal stays readable.
``DEBUG`` is printed on every timer callback, which is why it is verbose and hidden by default.

3 Add an entry point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ROS needs an entry point so ``ros2 run`` can start your node by name.
Navigate one level up to the package root, where ``setup.py`` and ``package.xml`` were created.
Open ``setup.py``.
Fill in the ``maintainer``, ``maintainer_email``, ``description``, and ``license`` fields to match your ``package.xml``, then add a console script entry:

.. code-block:: python

  entry_points={
      'console_scripts': [
          'battery_monitor = battery_logging.battery_monitor:main',
      ],
  },

Save the file.

4 Build and source the workspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build the package so the new entry point is installed, then source the workspace overlay so ``ros2 run`` can find it.

Return to the root of your workspace and build:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      $ cd ~/ros2_ws
      $ colcon build --packages-select battery_logging
      $ source install/setup.bash

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      $ cd ~/ros2_ws
      $ colcon build --packages-select battery_logging
      $ source install/setup.bash

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      $ cd \dev\ros2_ws
      $ colcon build --packages-select battery_logging
      $ call install\setup.bat

5 Run the node with the default log level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First run the node with no log-level override.
That shows which severities appear under the default filter.

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 run battery_logging battery_monitor

The node runs until the battery reaches 0 % and then shuts down.
You should see output similar to:

.. code-block:: console

  [INFO] [battery_monitor]: Battery monitor started, initial level 100%
  [WARN] [battery_monitor]: Battery low, please return to dock
  [ERROR] [battery_monitor]: Battery critically low at 10%, stop immediately
  [FATAL] [battery_monitor]: Battery depleted, shutting down battery monitor
  [INFO] [battery_monitor]: Battery monitor shutting down

Notice that there are no ``DEBUG`` lines for each battery reading.
By default, ROS shows ``INFO`` and higher (``WARN``, ``ERROR``, ``FATAL``).
``DEBUG`` is below that default, so the per-callback readings stay hidden.

6 Reveal DEBUG logs with the CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the previous step, the node created a ``DEBUG`` message for each battery reading, but the default log level hid those messages.
To print them, set the log level to ``debug`` when you start the node.

Start by setting the level for the battery monitor only so that you see its ``DEBUG`` messages without also printing messages from internal library loggers:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 run battery_logging battery_monitor --ros-args --log-level battery_monitor:=debug

Now you should also see a stream of lines such as:

.. code-block:: console

  [DEBUG] [battery_monitor]: Battery level: 100%
  [DEBUG] [battery_monitor]: Battery level: 95%
  [DEBUG] [battery_monitor]: Battery level: 90%

The node was already creating those messages.
The CLI log level only controls whether they are printed.

You can also set a global log level to ``debug``:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 run battery_logging battery_monitor --ros-args --log-level debug

A global ``debug`` setting applies to every logger in the process, not only ``battery_monitor``.
That includes internal ROS libraries such as ``rcl``, so you may see many extra ``DEBUG`` lines that are unrelated to the battery monitor.
If you want global ``DEBUG`` for your own code but still hide those library messages, set ``rcl`` back to ``info``:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 run battery_logging battery_monitor --ros-args --log-level debug --log-level rcl:=info

7 Choose an appropriate severity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CLI only controls which messages are shown.
The severity you pick in code is what operators and later debugging sessions work with.
If you put too many routine messages at ``INFO``, operators may struggle to spot the important ones among them.
If you log a real fault at ``DEBUG``, it stays hidden until someone sets the log level to ``debug``.

Use this node as a model for when each level fits:

* ``DEBUG``: frequent detail that helps while diagnosing a problem, but is too verbose for normal operation.
* ``INFO``: routine lifecycle or status that operators usually want to see.
* ``WARN``: something is wrong, but the system can continue if the operator responds.
* ``ERROR``: a serious fault that needs immediate attention.
* ``FATAL``: the node cannot continue.

Logging ``FATAL`` does not stop the process by itself.
This example raises ``SystemExit`` after the fatal message so that the node shuts down cleanly.

8 Optional: inspect the same logs in ``rqt_console``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Log messages are not limited to the terminal.
They are also published on the ``/rosout`` topic, so you can view and filter them in a GUI with :doc:`Using rqt_console <../Using-Rqt-Console/Using-Rqt-Console>`.

In a new terminal, start ``rqt_console``:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ros2 run rqt_console rqt_console

In another terminal, run the battery monitor with ``--log-level battery_monitor:=debug``.
In ``rqt_console``, exclude ``Debug`` and confirm that the remaining messages match the terminal output from the default log-level run.

FAQs
----

Why do I not see DEBUG messages when I first run the battery monitor?
   By default, ROS shows log severities of ``INFO`` and above.
   ``DEBUG`` is below that default, so those messages are generated but not printed.
   Run the node with ``--ros-args --log-level battery_monitor:=debug`` to show them.

What is the difference between WARN, ERROR, and FATAL?
   ``WARN`` means there is a problem the operator can still recover from, such as a low battery.
   ``ERROR`` means a serious fault that needs immediate action.
   ``FATAL`` means the node cannot continue.
   In this tutorial, the node logs ``FATAL`` at 0 % and then shuts itself down.

Does logging FATAL automatically stop my node?
   No.
   ``FATAL`` is only a severity level for the message.
   Your code must still stop timers, destroy the node, or shut down ``rclpy`` if the process should exit.

Why do I see many rcl DEBUG lines when I use ``--log-level debug``?
   A global ``debug`` level applies to more loggers than your node alone, including internal ``rcl`` loggers.
   Narrow the setting with ``--log-level battery_monitor:=debug``, or hide ``rcl`` ``DEBUG`` messages with ``--log-level debug --log-level rcl:=info``.

How do I change the log level when I run a node?
   Pass ROS arguments after ``--ros-args``.
   For example: ``ros2 run battery_logging battery_monitor --ros-args --log-level battery_monitor:=debug``.
